Yoga-Pose-Classification-Video-Dataset-
Me and my team did this project in Machine Learning class at Asian Institute of Technology. 
In this project, we collected the videos of 5 yoga poses such as "Cobra", "DownDog", "Standing Forward Bend", "Tree" and "Warrior 1" from 2 yoga practitioners and some of our friends from AIT.
